                    Historically through the 1940´s till the 1980´s probably the finest optical spherical and anamorphic
                    solutions for the cinematography industry were handcrafted and while most of their orignal designs
                    saw
                    the
                    light in Europe, Japan or U.S.A mainly, their manufacturing proccess involved skilled crafstmen
                    rather
                    than
                    machines producing lenses under the spell of old recipes which may include may include processes no
                    longer
                    available today to produce such lenses but capable to produce an image with a unique charm and whole
                    new
                    world of different characteristics to create different looks.
                    With the use today´s digital cine cameras vs. the before prevalent film format cameras, the
                    possibilities of
                    using different films stocks and the manipulation of the then available film format limited,
                    cinematographers started to fight against a new format that offered many new possibilities but also
                    brought
                    other difficulties; like the often distacting or even disturbing details shown by the combination of
                    too
                    much resolution and tack sharper modern lenses. In response to that artists in their search to
                    create
                    different looks ended up recurring to either on camera filtration or the use of old lenses to find
                    out
                    that
                    the images paired with these old lenses with the new digital sensors gived them results impossible
                    to
                    replicate with modern lenses.
                    These tools are one of the cinema´s best kept secret and have been in the hands of filmmakers, still
                    photographers and cinematographers for decades helping them to create a unique visual imagery
                    capable of
                    empowering their storytelling. Nevertheless, it wasn´t only until a few years ago, when these
                    vintage
                    lenses
                    really went into a revival when some serious optical manufacturing companies started refurbishing
                    and
                    repurposing these old optical gems to give them a new and better life inside new modern housings,
                    propper
                    focus markings and a state of art improved mechanics.
                    We as filmmakers and cinematographers envisioned this phenomena and after not being pleased with the
                    lens
                    options available on the mainstream market, we ended up finding ourselves immediately attracted to
                    these
                    tools which somehow have been forgotten a bit for while. In our search we ended up locating and
                    aquiring
                    only the best optical pieces (some of them often in museum like condition to our surprise) to have
                    them
                    carefully reconditioned and redesigned for its use on modern digital cinema cameras. We ended up
                    refurbishing for use today a a lens collection that could well be a living museum sourced from all
                    over
                    the
                    world and that has the very own favorite focal lengths of the Stanley Kubrick lens collection in the
                    UK,
                    the
                    legendary Kurosawa's Studio in Japan and other major studios in USA, Mexico, Italy, Poland and other
                    places.
                    But after, we thought the lens collection and the museum was not enough and we created a dedicated
                    and
                    creative space that acts like an image labororaty to honor our lens collection and a studio with all
                    the
                    tools you might need in one place to create your own personalized look for your films, commercials,
                    music
                    videos, TV shows and other media content.
                    Our collection includes a massive selection of the best examples of all the rarest and most
                    beautiful
                    lenses
                    we could find of from all different eras, we take great pride to say we keep this jewels in the best
                    condition possible and maintain them regularly specially because we also use them for in house
                    production
                    projects but that is not all we can offer, we will help your production to get any kind of gear or
                    resources
                    you might need.
                    While we redesign and repurposed our lenses lenses for today's use, we also try to respect their
                    character
                    and original designs to offer filmmakers, cinematographers and still photographers a right mix this
                    amazing
                    (best kept secret) classic tools and all the best modern cameras and accesories so you can create
                    images
                    without limits.
